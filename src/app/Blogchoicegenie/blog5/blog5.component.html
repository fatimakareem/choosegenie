            <p>Now,  when  you  shop  for  electricity  plans,  have  a  look  at  how much  of  it  is  from renewable sources  as  some plans claim to be 100% green!</p>
            <h2>Reason to Switch # 4: Switch Incentives</h2>
            <p>ChoiceGenie   provides   customer   incentives   for   switching electricity plans.
            </p>
      
        <p>Not  only  that,  introductory  rates  are  also  offered to  new customers!</p>
        <p>The  customers  may  receive  additional  incentives;  prepaid  gift cards,  loyalty  rewards,  smart  thermostats,  and  memberships into  clubs  in  exchange  for  signing  a  long-term  contract  with  an electricity company.</p>
            

            <h2>Reason to Switch # 5: Top-notch Customer Service</h2>
        <p>Customer service matters!</p>
             <p>It  is  worth  to  start  exploring  new  providers  if  you  have  had  a bad experience.<p>
        <p>ChoiceGenie is all about better customer service experience for customers’ ease.
            </p>
            <p>Customer  complaints  are  often  reported  to  the  state’s  Public Utility Commission.</p>
            <p>Thus,  electricity  providers  are  very  competitive  and  strive  to provide top-notch service.</p>
            <h2>False Beliefs</h2>
        <p>Some  have  misconceptions  that,  when they choose to switch to an  electricity  plan  through  new  electricity  provider,  they  might be a period of no electricity.</p>
        <p>It doesn’t work like that in states with deregulated electricity.</p>
        <p>Utility companies are under an obligation bring electricity unless of  course the power is disconnected for whatever reason mainly non-payment.</p>
       
        <h2>Wrap Up!</h2>
          <p>Customers   in   electricity   deregulated   state   are   advised   to compare rates to ensure you are dealt with the best plan.</p>
        <p>Consider switching  electricity  plans,  for  electricity  rate, incentive programs, green energy and long-term fixed rates.</p>
